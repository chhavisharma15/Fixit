# Business Details

Often, users get frustrated when they need maintenance services to cater to an appliance which needs repair or when a new device is to be installed. This can be both an expensive and inefficient service to locate. In addition to that, it is common that multiple clients in the same or nearby locality require a similar maintenance service. Our platform has tie-ups with licensed and reliable maintenance service companies which can cater not to just one problem at a time, but multiple!

The cost for the client may be reduced as when residents in a locality request for a similar service. Fixit optimizes travel, causes lesser hassle and save both time and money for the technician. Not just that, but Fixit also gives you an estimate of cost prior to the delivery service.

Our user friendly one-stop destination for all essential maintenance needs offers services ranging from Installation & Repair of electrical appliances, to plumbing to Relocation & logistics.
